# Introduction
CAN (Controller Area Network) is an advanced bus communication system, initially developed for automotive applications but has since become prevalent in various industrial applications. It facilitates robust and reliable communication among microcontrollers and devices without the need for a host computer.

This repository presents a seamless approach for connecting an Arduino with a Raspberry Pi 4 via CAN. This union of an immensely popular microcontroller and a versatile single-board computer extends the horizons for automation and data acquisition applications. Through the meticulous steps laid out here, both newcomers to CAN and seasoned developers will find a clear path to integrating these devices and maximizing their joint potential.
